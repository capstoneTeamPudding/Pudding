//Params aren't only useful for passing some data to a new screen, but they can also be useful to pass data to a previous screen too. For example, let's say you have a screen with a create post button, and the create post button opens a new screen to create a post. After creating the post, you want to pass the data for the post back to previous screen. To achieve this, you can use the navigate method, which acts like goBack if the screen already exists. You can pass the params with navigate to pass the data back: docs: https://reactnavigation.org/docs/params
